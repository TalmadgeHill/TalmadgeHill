				<p>At the heart of any church is Worship. You are welcome to join us each Sunday of the year and other times as well, for special Services of Worship. We have a thriving Sunday School and an Adult Education program as well. Talmadge Hill Church is a lovely setting for a Wedding and our staff is willing and able to help couples create a meaningful experience to honor the beginning of a marriage.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Music</b></p>
				<p>Our Music Program includes writing, preparing and presenting new music for worship, a choir, a children&#8217;s choir, and special guest musicians, as well as a monthly Performing Arts Series. <a title="Choir Page" href="http://choir.talmadgehillcommunitychurch.com/" target="_blank">Choir Page</a></p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Educational Programs at </b><b>Talmadge Hill Community Church</b></p>
				<p>Sunday School meets each Sunday of the year during the 10:30 service of worship and welcomes all children who are able to participate in its activities (beginning about age three and continuing through middle-school age).</p>
				<p>During the school year we offer Sunday School to young children led by our master teacher, Tracy Castelli using the Godly Play curriculum. In a separate room the older children work from the Feasting on the Word curriculum focused especially on that age group.</p>
				<p>All children are encouraged to participate in the community worship and to join in the educational programs designed especially for them. Usually the children attend the beginning of the worship service with their families and then move to the Sunday School after gathering for a Prayer for the Children.</p>
				<p>From the very beginning, children are welcome at Talmadge Hill Church. We believe that their religious education begins with their earliest experiences of worship with their parents.</p>
				<p><em><b>Sunday School</b></em></p>
				<p>For our young children, we use the <i>Godly Play </i>curriculum which enables children of different age levels to study the same story from the Bible, and allows for children to use their own talents to arrive at their own understanding of the story. This approach is consistent with our philosophy for how all of us develop a relationship with God and with the church&#8211;by coming to it through personal exploration and reflection.</p>
				<p>The Sunday school teacher is the “Storyteller”, who tells the story from the Bible, using simple props, such as wooden figures, or a box filled with sand to represent the desert, or different colored felt underlays to represent the sea or the earth. After listening to the story, the children ponder questions, which always begin with “I wonder…” All answers are welcomed and accepted, and lively discussions may follow.  After the wondering, we have a work period, or response time, for the children to process the story in his or her own way.  There are a variety of choices at this time- the children can choose to use the actual story materials to re-tell the story on their own, or they have the choice of using art materials to color, paint, build, or create with clay.  They may also choose to use dramatic play materials, or to write about what they are thinking about.  After the work time, we get ready for our “feast” together, and Thanksgiving prayers before joining up with parents after their church service.</p>
				<p><em><b>Youth and Young Adults</b></em></p>
				<p>We have a lively Youth Initiative that meets the first and third Sunday of the month during the school year and at other times for special activities.  The program is primarily relational, experiential and hands-on. It is meant to offer a welcoming and affirming climate in which adolescents can begin to relate to church on their own terms. Our Youth group is led by the Rev. Carter Via, Kate Cummiskey,  and Jon Morgan working with a curriculum focused on character development in the context of a growing faith.</p>
				<p><strong><em>Confirmation </em></strong></p>
				<p>Our Confirmation Class is taught &#8220;Oxford&#8221; style which means that the pastors meet with one or more candidates in tutorial sessions throughout their ninth-grade year to prepare them to decide if they wish to join the church as adults. Confirmation candidates are also expected to participate in our Youth Initiative which meets every other Sunday evening during the school year. At the conclusion of the tutorial, each young person will write a statement of belief and a report on their experience of community service. Through this study, each participant will be able to formulate and articulate their own current relationship with God, the Bible and the Church.</p>
				<p><em><b>Adult Education</b></em></p>
				<p>Please check the current newsletter for listings.</p>
				<p>Bible studies are offered most Monday evenings at 7:30 and during the school year.</p>
