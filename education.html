				<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Christian Education for 2015/2016</strong></div>

				<p>We offer three programs geared and customized to the age group of your children.  The programs are detailed below, but before discussing the differences between the programs, we also want you to know the common approaches and themes of our programs.  There are three foundational goals for our youth education program:</p>

				<br>

				<ul>

					<li><strong>Safety. </strong>Your child’s physical safety will always be a first priority for THCC.  But our programs are also designed to provide our kids with an <em>emotionally</em> safe environment.  What that means is a space and group that allows our kids to feel safe being themselves – without the pressures that they often feel in so many other spheres of their lives.  We commit to witnessing their authentic selves and their unique gifts.  But we also emphasize that they are called by our Christian faith to share these gifts with the wider world.</li>
			
				</ul>

				<br>

				<ul>

					<li><strong>Teaching Happens Here.</strong> We want our kids to have a good time, but that is not the primary purpose of Christian education.  The purpose is for our kids to learn more about their Christian faith and what it means to live that truth in their life.  All of our programs have specific curriculum that has been designed or customized for our purposes.  We discuss the specific programs below.</li>

				</ul>

				<br>

				<ul>

					<li><strong>Building Church Community.</strong> One of the most impressive gains for our programs over the past several years has been the enthusiasm of our kids to come to Church and attend our sessions.  We want our children to understand that part of the Christian faith is the Christian community – and they are an important part of that community.</li>

				</ul>

				<p><img class="img-rounded center-block img-responsive" src="images/school.jpg"></p>
				
    			<br>
				
				<p class="card-text">Building on these foundations, the three programs we offer are the following:</p>
				<br>

				<p><strong>Sunday School (grades K-4) during 10:30 Worship Service</strong></p>

				<p>Our Sunday School is led by Tracy Castelli, a trained Montessori teacher and mother of two.  This is Tracy’s third year leading our Sunday School.  This year, Tracy will be building on some of the techniques in Godly Play to design a customized curriculum that is based on virtues (e.g. friendship, courage, etc.)  The class will discuss what that virtue means and how it is represented through a bible story.  The children will also have an opportunity to share an experience in their life that is representative of the virtue.  The goal is use the virtues and the Bible to connect our religious education to our everyday life and offer our children the tools to navigate our world.  A listing of session topics is attached to this document.</p>

				<br>

				<p><strong>SPARK, or Spiritual Path and Righteous Knowledge, (grades 5-8) during 10:30 Worship Service</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Youth Initiative (grades 9-12) on the First and Third Sundays, 6pm at THCC</strong></p>

				<p>We are excited about Youth Initiative this Fall.  The program, now in it’s fourth year, will continue to be led by the team of Carter Via, Jon Morgan and Kate Cummiskey.  As always, it is our intention to create a safe environment, a place for open and honest dialogue, an opportunityto reflect on our spiritual lives, and the presence of a supportive community.  Beginning on September 18 and then on the first Sunday of every month, we will meet at THCC (6:00-7:30 p.m.) for our regular meeting.  On the third Sunday of every month, we are going to collaborate with Gary and the Youth Program at the First Congregational Church in Darien (FCCD) to offer an informal, non-traditional, and fun worship service.  The youth at both churches will be actively involved in the design and execution of these services, and initially they will take place at FCCD from 5:00-5:45 p.m.  See below for an outline of this Fall’s calendar.</p>

				<br>

				<p><strong>Confirmation (grades 8 and 9) during the 10:30 Worship Service, Location TBA</strong></p>

				<p>In addition to the three programs designed for various age groups, this year we will also be offering a Confirmation programs for our 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  The program will be led Rev. Carter Via and will include the following: four 45-minute sessions that will take place during the church service in October, November, February and March.  The topics for these sessions are:</p>

				<br>

				<ol>

					<li>God,</li>

					<li>Jesus</li>

					<li>The Church</li>

					<li>What Does it Mean to Commit to the Christian Message</li>

				</ol>

				<br>

				<p>In addition, our confirmands will complete a personal faith statement and meet with Carter individually to discuss it.  We also expect our confirmands to participate in at least one church-sponsored service event (e.g. Midnight Run, Feed My Starving Children, Homefront).  Candidates who complete the program will be confirmed at our Youth Sunday service in late May.  If your son or daughter is interested in the confirmation process and is in 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> grade, please speak to Carter.</p>

				<br>

				<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

				<p>If you have further questions or need more details, feel free to reach out to Carter, Jon Morgan or any of the individual teachers.  We have been so impressed by the passion around youth education at Talmadge Hill and we expect to have a great year.</p>

				<br>

				<p><strong>Bible Studies for Adults</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Throughout the year there is usually a Bible Study on Monday evenings from 7:30-8:45. Please check the calendar for our current offerings.</li>
					<li>A second group meets during the academic year at 9:30 on Thursday mornings.</li>
