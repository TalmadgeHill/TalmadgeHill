<h1>Ten Ways to Get Involved</h1>
            
            <p>1. Come worship with us<br />
Services are 9 and 10:30 during the school year and at 9:30 in the summer. Dress is comfortable and all are heartily welcomed. Friends are always welcome, too.</p>
<p>2. Hang around after the Service of Worship<br />
Please stay for the fellowship hour that occurs each Sunday following the 10:30 service. We gather around a simple buffet of snacks with coffee, tea and refreshments and it gives us all an opportunity to visit with one another. It can take courage to venture into a crowd of people whom you don’t know; remember, we are always delighted to see you.</p>
<p>3. Check out an adult Bible study<br />
Come, participate or just listen. Some of our discussions are based on specific reading assignments, though meaningful attendance doesn’t require having completed the readings. We offer Bible studies in the Merritt Room on Monday evenings 7:30-8:45 and on Thursday mornings from 9:30-10:45. Please consult our calendar to see the current topic of study.</p>
<p>4. Sign on for a Missions project<br />
At Talmadge Hill, we put a large emphasis on missions—in fact, 22% of the monies we take in goes directly toward our numerous missions projects. We engage in projects that are local, international, accessible and measurable. For more information, see our Missions tab. Invariably, participants say they get back more than they give when they participate in these efforts. We welcome your talents and treasure in our missions efforts.</p>
<p>5. Join the Choir<br />
Our choir sings about once a month from September through June. Practices are usually held on Thursday night at 730. Membership is open to any adult or teen who desires to sing; auditions are not necessary. Please contact Rob Silvan at if you would like more information.</p>
<p>6. Act as greeter and coffee hour host<br />
At our 10:30 service of worship, our hosts greet parishioners, help serve communion and host an informal coffee hour. Hosting is easy and all the instructions can be found under the Hosting tab.</p>
<p>7. Take on a role in reading the Scripture in the worship service<br />
Each week a parishioner reads a passage selected by our ministers, Carter and Mich. No public speaking experience is necessary; we find having different voices read from the Scripture makes the passages come to life. Please be in contact with Mich or Carter to volunteer.</p>
<p>8. Attend one of our Special events<br />
Throughout the year, we host events that celebrate the season and and draw us together. These events are open to all and go by names such as the Mothers’ Day brunch, Fathers’ Day Picnic, All-Church retreat, Christmas Candlelight concert, the Thanksgiving eve service, the Christmas Eve service, and more. Want to be included on our eblasts? Contact our Parish Administrator, Debbie Previte at <a href="http://talmadgehillchurch@gmail.com">talmadgehillchurch@gmail.com </a></p>
<p>9. Participate in a Prayer Circle</p>
<p>10. Join a committee<br />
The work of individuals helping on our various church committees is essential in advancing the work of Talmadge Hill. Our Committees include: Buildings and Grounds, Congregational Life, Education, Membership, Missions, Stewardship, Music and Worship and Finance.
